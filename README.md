# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration in SQL Server

This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover trends, infection rates, death ratios, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths**  
  → Shows the likelihood of dying if infected (case fatality rate)

- **Total Cases vs. Population**  
  → Percentage of population infected per country

- **Countries with Highest Death Count per Population**  
  → Identifies regions with severe mortality impact

- **Breakdown by Continent**  
  → Highlights continents with the highest death rates

- **Population vs. Vaccinations**  
  → Tracks global vaccination progress relative to population
